The boy went down with just a swing.


Don’t get him wrong; he loved the kid, he did. He was a good man with a good head on his shoulders—the type of fella that wouldn’t hurt a fly on a good day. But those days just weren’t good days and that day happened to be his worst. 


He really didn’t mean to, that’s for certain. It was all just—luck. Just bad, bad luck.


***


It was a dark and stormy night: the kind of night that was too cold like bitter melon soup with the kind of rain that was too mean like the biggest bully in the playground. It was the kind of night where the worst was the best, where things would just go all twisted, all wrong, all tangled up in knots. And everything was already all knots but that night bad became worse.


He was sitting in his old recliner, beer in one hand and a remote flipping through a thousand channels in the other. There wasn’t really much else to do at night; she was long gone and he stopped caring about making messes ever since the one mess that changed everything. Didn’t need to bother looking after the boy either—brat avoided him like a leper nowadays. Was as close to him as an atheist was with God.


Another swig. The beer numbed the bitterness, a mother’s smooches on a bruise.


Kid moseyed in around the fourth bottle. 


He doesn’t remember what the boy said, rarely does these days—things all sound the same when your brain’s all fogged up with funny juice. 


But he reckons that it was the eyes that got him—doe eyes with whites too white and lashes too long and greens too green. Too much like the one he got ‘em from, too much like those blown-black ones from that time.


That time he found out that the one gal he’d ever love didn’t love him back.


He could’ve sworn he’d seen them, then and there, right in front of him, right where the kid was. Could’ve sworn he’d heard the sounds, the noises, the little, useless excuses spilling out from a swollen mouth. Could’ve sworn he got sent back to way back when, back to someplace at sometime where he wasn’t supposed to be. Felt some Old Testament wrath start creeping through his skin.


And from there everything went to hell.


***


He remembers his old dog, Bailey.


She was a silly rascal—a yellow-furred mutt whose tail was always wagging and paws were always clambering up to the knees, begging for a treat. 


He remembers his Bailey, in all her excitable, puppy-joy glory. Remembers when she moved to the farm one day. Remembers how much he missed her but knew it was for the best. Remembers that it was only about a good three years later that he found out there wasn’t any farm.


Ma ran over the poor thing and didn’t want him to know. Made up the whole fib and buried her secret in the backyard. 


He looks at the halo of brown locks lying in red and thinks that this was probably how she felt back then.


Like mother, like son; he panics. Scurries over to the youngling, heart beating fast like the beer gushing out from the broken bottle. Boy ain’t breathing. He could barely feel the little thump-thump-thump that he should feel when he places two fingers at the scamp’s neck. 


“F██.” 


His throat’s scorching, burning bad like all hell. Hands in his hair, he curses again and again, scraping away at his scalp as if it’d help with anything.


“Gotta calm—gotta calm down.”


Closes his eyes. Deep breaths.


In.


Out. 


In.


Out.


Okay.


First things first: 


1. Move the body. Hide the crime, do no time.
2. Head straight to the car. Things’re too much now. Might as well leave it.
















His sins stared back at him with milk eyes.


He took a bite. Let it sit in his mouth for a bit like he was feasting on holy bread.


The meat tasted sweet. 






“It matters not for the tree has fallen.”
