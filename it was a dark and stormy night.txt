The boy went down with just a swing.


Don’t get him wrong; he loved the kid, he did. He was a good man with a good head on his shoulders—the type of fella that wouldn’t hurt a fly on a good day. But those days just weren’t good days and that day happened to be his worst. 


He really didn’t mean to, that’s for certain. It was all just—luck. Just bad, bad luck.

It was a dark and stormy night: the kind of night that was too cold like bitter melon soup with the kind of rain that was too mean like the biggest bully in the playground. It was the kind of night where the worst was the best, where things would just go all twisted, all wrong, all tangled up in knots. And everything was already all knots but that night bad became worse.


He was sitting in his old recliner, beer in one hand and a remote flipping through a thousand channels in the other. There wasn’t really much else to do at night; she was long gone and he stopped caring about making messes ever since the one mess that changed everything. Didn’t need to bother looking after the boy either—brat avoided him like a leper nowadays. Was as close to him as an atheist was with God.


Another swig. The beer numbed the bitterness, a mother’s smooches on a bruise.


Kid walked in around the fourth bottle. 
















It was the eyes that got him, he reckons—doe eyes with lashes too long and irises too green. Too much like the one he got ‘em from, too much like those blown-black ones from that time.


That time he found out that the one gal he’d ever love didn’t love him back.








And everything went to hell.








He was slumped in his good ol’ chair in front his good ol’ telly having a good ol’ time with some good ol’ bottles of beer.

His sins stared back at him with milk eyes.

He took a bite. Let it sit in his mouth for a bit like he was feasting on holy bread.


The meat tasted sweet.
